A category-defining enterprise loan intelligence platform that transforms syndicated loan agreements into a living, continuously updated covenant graph.

## Overview

Covenant Graph is not document storage. It's not reporting software. It's a **decision-support system** for syndicated loan markets that provides:

- **Graph-native visualization** of covenant relationships and dependencies
- **Amendment tracking** with visual diffs showing before/after states
- **Confidence-based compliance** assessment with full traceability
- **Bank-grade audit trails** for regulatory compliance

## Key Features

### 🔮 Covenant Graph View
The core innovation — a graph-native interface where nodes represent covenants and edges show dependencies. Hover for quick insights, click for full legal breakdowns.

### 📜 Amendment Timeline
Legal change mode with visual representation of how each amendment impacts the covenant structure. See removed logic fade and new obligations emerge.

### ✅ Compliance State
Beyond binary red/green indicators. Each covenant shows confidence levels, reasoning paths, and data sources with "Why?" interaction for step-by-step explanations.

### 📊 Activity & Audit
Immutable, human-readable logs of every system action — uploads, edits, approvals, and state changes — suitable for regulatory review.
